#AS THE GENERAL INSTALLATION COMPLETELY CHANGED WE HAVE SHIFTED FROM ARCH LINUX TO WINDOWS 7 [so it works lol]

#This change removes a lot of the headaches, but introduces some new ones, and in this file I will explain and document a repeatable package that can be installed on every computer.

#SOME REALLY FUN ASPECTS

##DRIVERS
##because every computer is completely different, the drivers need to be manually installed. not a huge problem but what can make this more difficult is a lack of wifi drivers. the best tool for the driver solution is SDIO [https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin/]
##its a crazy tool and works great.

##CS:S
##The unpacker we are using is the Counter-Strike Source package application. Produces best results, and is stored in the games directory. 
##To change the name of the user it is in the settings tab in the game, very easy.

##FIREFOX
##no explaination, it's on the drive but you prolly dont need to use it

##ACTION CAPTURE/MACROS
##Super program called tinytask. Completely free, easy to use, ridiculously light, and perfect. [https://www.tinytask.net/index.html]
