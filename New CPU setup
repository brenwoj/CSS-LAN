New Computer Setup

[things that need to be changed]
*[[Drivers - SDIO]]
**[[AHK lockdown - easy script]]
***[[CS:S install + modified files]]
****[[Start menu modifications - look at CPU1]]
*****[[Background image in startup]]

*After setting Windows 7 pro up, the first thing that needs to happen is updating the driver. To do this we use SDIO [Snappy driver installer origin]

Transfer SDIO to the desktop of the new machine, and then run the SDIO_R816.exe. 
Select all of the drivers that need to be updated and then click install (x) on the left side of the screen. 
It takes some time, but once done all is working great.

Once complete restart system.

**AHK

Transfer AHK from the USB to the new machine.
Run AutoHotkey_1.1.37.02_setup
go to program files > AutoHotKey > Compiler > Ahk2exe
select the script in the AHK folder transferred from the USB.
Compile the script into a .exe and then move it into the startup folder

***CS:S

Transfer CounterStrikeSource folder in CPU_Setup to the desktop of the new machine.
Open the folder, run the installation .exe

Once CS:S is installed in the games folder, go to Counter-Strike Source>cstrike and replace the cfg and resource with the ones on the USB.
Then run the game and change the name of the user to match the current CPU
After everything looks good, transfer the shortcut on the desktop to the startup folder so it starts on bootup. 


****Start menu modifications:

lock down task manager
lock down taskbar
lock down startmenu
lock down ctl alt del screen [get rid of shutdown settings and limit choices]

4. Go to:

  [you will  need to make the info folder and inside make the backgrounds folder final path is C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds]

    backgroundDefault.jpt

6. Test with win+l or restart.
